This is an admin dashboard for [Roundware](https://github.com/roundware/roundware-server). Uses APIv2.

This is built using AngularJS. It mostly follows [John Papa's](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md) and [Minko Gechev's](https://github.com/mgechev/angularjs-style-guide) style guides. Less consideration is given to [Todd Motto's](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide) guide.
